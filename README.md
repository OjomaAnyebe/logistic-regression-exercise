# Logistic Regression - Exercise Solution

This repository contains the solution to the "Building a Logistic Regression - Exercise," part of my data science learning journey on Udemy.

## About the Exercise

This exercise focuses on building a logistic regression model. The dataset used explores binary classification, a fundamental concept in machine learning.

### Objectives

- Implement logistic regression from scratch.
- Interpret key performance metrics.
- Understand the impact of features on model predictions.

### Dataset Overview

The dataset includes the following columns:
- **Feature 1**: [Description of the feature, if known]
- **Feature 2**: [Description of the feature, if known]
- **Target**: Binary classification (0 or 1).

### Tools and Libraries Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib**: For data visualization.
- **Statsmodels**: For statistical analysis.

### Key Steps in the Notebook

1. Import the necessary libraries.
2. Load and explore the dataset.
3. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA).
4. Build and evaluate the logistic regression model.
5. Visualize the results.

## Learning Journey

This exercise is part of my commitment to mastering data science through the Udemy platform. It showcases my hands-on application of logistic regression concepts.
